csv INPUT files read into an object in your script with
one header row and one data row will be missing methods and properties.

e.g. The count property is missing.
This is what I did to work around the issue.

# Check if the Count property exists, and add it if not then Add Count property!
$csvdata=import-csv c:\temp\i.csv

if (-not $csvData | Get-Member -MemberType NoteProperty -Name Count) {
    $count = ($csvData | Measure-Object).Count
    $csvData | Add-Member -NotePropertyName Count -NotePropertyValue $count
}
