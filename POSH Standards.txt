PowerShell Standards by TFR aka Tedmond Lasseter


Standards for Functions are:
1. Comments of #---- should appear before and after function
2. names of functions should start with prefix fn_

Standards for Variables are:
1. Parameters for the script should start with prefix of p
2. Global variables should start with prefix of GBL_
3. Variables in functions should start with fn_IF_
4. Script variables that are NOT in a function should start with prefix s_
5. write-host cmdlets are replaced with write-host in the syntax
6. if an EXIT cmdlet is in the powershell script, Professor Posh will mark with the comment of "## STOP Run ##" before and after the word EXIT

Professor POSH will use these standards when asked to refactor code
