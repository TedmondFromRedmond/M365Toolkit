Enclosed, you will find a utility that pauses execution and prompts the user with a custom message and traps only one key.

As of July 4th, 2024 Anykey was a 10 year old utility that has morphed over the years and been shared with just about every customer I have worked with.

How to use:
1. Download the directory
2. Look at the fn_AnyKey.ps1 file and incorporate to your code as you see fit.

The code is self documenting and one will notice the PowerShell Doctype when viewing. 
By incorporating the function into code, one can call the function with a custom message.

As a bonus, I have included my pester files if you want to make changes, learn pester and practice coding.

Cordially,
